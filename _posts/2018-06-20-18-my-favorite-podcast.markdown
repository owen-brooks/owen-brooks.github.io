Currently I have about a one hour commute, each way, to my summer job. While I listened to them before, podcast have quickly become my go to tool for media consumption. I attend to use this post as a ongoing list of the shows I listen to


# The List 
*Quick note: This list is in no general order. I do not support many of the ideas presented in the podcasts listed below. This list is meant to create exposure for some great podcasts.*

* **The Knowledge Project** – Shane Parrish is a excellent speaker and interviews a ton of interesting people. The shows are usually around a hour long. I highly recommend the interview with Chris Voss – a FBI negotiator turned business coach.

* **The Tim Ferris Show** – This show includes interviews with many of the most successful venture capitalists, founder and athletes. Ferris seems to have one of the widest networks of anyone and silicon valley. He has also a prominent venture capitalist; he shares the techniques that have made him widely successful in that area.

* **Obsessed Garage** – Show by a popular car youtuber. He has a very interesting and obsessive philosophy when it comes to wealth. He also has a pretty good car collection including two Ford Raptors and a GT3.

* **The Smoking Tire** – Another car show. The best episodes are interviews with automotive engineers. I recommend the episode where he has on, the founder of Banks Power. Very interesting stuff on diesel engines.

* **Waking Up** – Not the biggest fan of Sam Harris’s views. He is however a amazing speaker and debater. He has great interviews with medical professionals such as a cancer researcher, and doctor who specializes in infant heart surgery.

* **Joe Rogan Experience** – By far the most popular podcast. The amount of views it gets per episode is staggering. The shows vary widely in quality and topic.

* **Hardcore History** – Definitely has the longest podcast episodes on this list. Dan Carlin creates extremely intricate storytelling and visuals in describing stories from history. While he often claims to not be a historian, Carlin does a unparalleled job of related our present day experience to the lives of those that came before us. Only podcast where I have listened to each episode multiple times.

* **Serial** – Extremely addicting crime show. Investigates cases that are highly controversial.

* **Levar Burton Reads** – Short stories, read by a man with a amazing voice. Listen to these, you will know what I mean.
