Last summer, I spent a relatively large amount of my Comcast co-op learning new languages, technologies and design methods. Time spent getting up to speed is to be expected. However, I could have been much more productive had I learned a few of the basic concepts before hand.

My goal with my co-op this summer is to hopefully reduce the amount of on the job time time spent learning Bloombergâ€™s tech stack. Obviously I can not learn any proprietary software or technologies, but this should be a good start.

I created this list from a combination of the job posting, interviews, and the past co-op reviews. It is probably going to change as time goes on.

1. Take a deeper dive into **web crawling** and the more advanced techniques / methods

2. Create another project using **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy**

3. Learn the basics of **VBA**

4. Exploring using **Excel with Python**

5. Brush up on **SQL**
