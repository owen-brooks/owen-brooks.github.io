Hi, my name is Owen Brooks. I am 20 years old and live in Philadelphia, where I attend Drexel University. At Drexel, I am majoring in Computer Engineering. While my major is a mix of hardware and software classes, my interest is mainly in software development.

As Drexel is a co-op school, I have the opportunity to get three, 6-month co-op's. I am currently on my second, working for Comcast as a Software Engineer / Big-Data Developer.

I created this website for two purposes. Firstly, this website allows others to get to know me better. You can find links for links for my GitHub and LinkedIn on the home page. Secondly, I plan to use this site as a blog. In this blog, I want to talk about a variety of topics such as; coding, tech, current events, philosophy, etc.

Thanks!
