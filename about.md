Hi, my name is Owen Brooks. I am 21, live in Philadelphia, attend Drexel University. At Drexel, I am majoring in Computer Engineering. During the school year my classes are a mix of hardware and software but, my main interest is writing code!

Drexel is a co-op school, which means I get to do 3 6-month co-op's. I am currently on my second, working for Comcast as a Software Engineer / Big-Data Developer.

The main purpose of this site is to allow others to connect with me. You can find links for links for my GitHub and LinkedIn on the home page. Additionally, I plan to use this site to explore intersting topics I learn. Hopefully, you will like the stuff I write and if not - at least you will get to laugh at my spelling.

Thanks!
