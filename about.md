Hi, my name is Owen Brooks. I am 22, live in Philadelphia, and attend Drexel University.

Drexel is a co-op school, which means I got to do 3 6-month co-op's. I was lucky enough to do my co-op's at Bloomberg, Comcast, and G3 technologies.

The main purpose of this site is to allow others to connect with me. You can find links for links for my GitHub and LinkedIn on the home page. Additionally, I plan to use this to talk about interesting things I learn.

Thanks!
